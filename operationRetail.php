·        Periodic Audits/ Penetration Testing by External Auditors 

·        Unique session ids, Session Expiry period

·        Encrypted URLs using application key

·        Second Factor of authentication introduced for third party transfers (mPIN) as per RBI guidelines.

Remember:
 

·        You have 5 attempts to login. The password is case sensitive i.e p (small) is different from P (capital). So be careful while putting the password(s).
·        The password length for various passwords to be used for mobile banking are as follows:
o       login and transaction password : 6 characters
o       SMS password: 4 digits (numeric)
o       M PIN : 4 digits (numeric)
·        The password selected by user should contain minimum 6 characters and    maximum 28 characters.
·        At the time of first login to the services, you will be asked to change the password(s). If you have both the login and transaction passwords, you have to keep both distinct for security reasons. Once passwords are changed, the new passwords are to be keyed in.
·        The expiry periods for Login and Transaction passwords are 999 and 180 respectively. This period is from date of issue of password by the bank or change of password by the customer. If the service is not being used for the said periods, you will require new passwords to resume the same.
 
 

 

Unable to Log In:

In case your user id is disabled due to wrong/ incorrect password, then approach your branch (where you want to receive the duplicate password) and apply for a fresh password. The new password will be sent to branch after getting the same request from the branch. Submit the acknowledgement for activating your transaction password after receiving the new password. Login password will always be enabled.

Know your Mobile Banking Status/ Details:

To know your Mobile Banking status/details contact your branch, where you have forwarded the application form.

Or 24 hours help line:

          1800 180 2222 (All India Toll Free Number)

          0124-2340000 (Accessible from mobile)

Safeguard:

·        Do not reveal password(s over phone, mail etc to any person including Bank.
·        The passwords can be changed as frequently as you wish (using the facility available after logging specific flavor). Please change your password(s) before the passwords get expired or when the system prompts you to do so.
·        Do not click on website links/attachments in unknown/suspicious emails. These links may take you to replica of banks website and ask for keying in your user id and password(s).
·        Bank will never send any e-mail requesting to provide user-id/password and other sensitive information.
·        In case of doubt, reconfirm the PNBs website by double clicking the ‘padlock’ symbol/icon at the bottom right of the web page to ensure the site is running in secure mode before you input any confidential/sensitive information.
·        Clicking on the ‘padlock’ symbol/icon and server certification symbol will display details of the server certification in the favor of Punjab National Bank.
·        To ensure a safe and genuine login, always enter bank’s website through https://mobile.netpnb.com
·        In case there is any call, please confirm that the call is from the authorized person of the bank.
 
 
 

Activation of user id:

There are two cases where you should approach the branch for activating your user id.

·        When you receive a fresh password from the bank, you have to approach any branch to get transaction facility activated, as new transaction password comes in disable mode by default for security reasons.

·        Your user id gets disabled if you exceed more than 5 attempts with wrong passwords. In this case you have to approach your branch to get it activated.

Disable user id:

If you have lost your user id and password and you want to block the access to your Mobile Banking account then you may follow the following procedures to disable your Mobile Banking access.

·        Try to login with your user id and wrong passwords for more than 5 times, as you know user id gets disabled if you exceed more than 5 attempts with wrong passwords.

·        Approach your branch to get it disabled
